<p>Let's start with a definition.</p>
<p><b>The Universe</b> - the whole space and matter that situates in that space</p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<p><u><b>Assumption: the Universe is not a computer simulation.</b></u></p>
<p>This theory may be true, but if it is, then all is meaningless, cause our world is only a fiction, only zeros and ones. It doesn't matter) I don't see any sense in investigating what models and algorithms were used to create it. So this assumption is critical and needs to be underlined from the beginning. I hope you are on the same page with me on this question.</p>

<h3>Did the Universe come into being?</h3>
<p><b>Ex nihilo nihil fit</b> - nothing comes from nothing.</p>
<p>The Universe couldn't emerge out of nothing and it has always been present.</p>
