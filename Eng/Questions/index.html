<p>Let's start with a definition.</p>
<p><b>The Universe</b> - the whole space and matter that situates in that space</p>

<p><u><b>Assumption: the Universe is not a computer simulation.</b></u></p>
<p>This theory may be true, but if it is, then all is meaningless, cause our world is only a fiction, only zeros and ones. It doesn't matter) I don't see any sense in investigating what models and algorithms were used to create it. So this assumption is critical and needs to be underlined from the beginning. I hope you are on the same page with me on this question.</p>

<h2 id="C1">Space</h2>

<h3>Is space infinite?</h3>

<h3>Does the existence imply finiteness?</h3>

<h3>What are lines and planes?</h3>
<p>Lines and planes are dividers of space. They are imaginary. This why any volume of space doesn't consist of points, segments of a line, squares of planes.</p>

<h3>Does space not filled with matter exist?</h3>

<!-- Even if we can not define the smallest part of space, we can say that any part is consists of parts that are cubes. -->

<!-- Infinitely small - Karl Theodor Wilhelm Weierstraß and Augustin Louis Cauchy - Бесконечно малые величины - Коши и Вейерштрассе -->

<!-- Incommensurability of segments 5th century BC -->

<!-- Interesting thing:

1 = 2 = 3 - lengths of segments
infinity left - 1 - infinity right
infinity left - 1 - 2 - infinity right
infinity left - 1 - 2 - 3 - infinity right

- is infinity left > infinity right?
- is infinity left + 1 < 2 + 3 + infinity right?
- can we post a question that infinity left + 1 > infinity left + 1 + 2?

<h2 id="C3">Matter</h2>

<h3>What is a certain attribute of matter?</h3>
<p>Descartes, 1644: "You can't conceive a material object that doesn't occupy some space."</p>

<h3>Is there infinite quantity of matter?</h3>

<h3>Is matter always symmetric? or Is there an asymmetric matter?</h3>

<h3>Can fully unhomogeneous matter exist?</h3>

<h3>Are there different kinds of matter?</h3>

<h3>Can there be infinite number of kinds of matter?</h3>

<h3>Are there different shapes of matter?</h3>

<h3>Can matter change its character/kind?</h3>
<p>Parmenides: How can a thing be said to change as you say e.g. that air changed into water and fire? To change means to become what it is not, but to say of what is that it is not is simply untrue. What is cannot not be anything, for "not to be" means vanish out of existence. "it is" i.e. one single thing exists.<br/>
If there were change, whatever changes would have to go from non-being or being to non-being.
</p>
<p>Who are critics of Parmenides?</p>

<h3>Can there be infinitely small matter?</h3>

<h3>Can there be inifinite inner compoundness</h3>

<h3>Can there be infinitely big matter?</h3>

<h3>Can two kinds of matter coexist in one part of space? i.e. Can one part of space be filled with two different kings of matter simultaneously?</h3>
<p>So we can detect different kinds of matter according to the method of detection.</p>
<p><i>Maybe, should put it in Interaction.</i> </p>

<h3>Can matter take more/less space with changing its characteristics?</h3>

<h3>What Mendeleev's Table tells us?</h3>

<h3>Did the Universe come into being?</h3>
<p><b>Ex nihilo nihil fit</b> - nothing comes from nothing.</p>
<p>The Universe couldn't emerge out of nothing and it has always been present.</p>
<p>We also state the reverse: nothing goes to nothing, i.e. nothing can't disappear.</p>

<h3>Can matter even be divided into pieces?</h3>
<p>What holds "pieces" of some continouos piece of matter? What we divide? the matter itself or we just break the structure of not directly connected pieces?</p>

<h2 id="C4">Movement</h2>

<h3>Can you travel in two directions simultaneously?</h3>

<!-- How people crack Zeno's paradoxes? -->

<h2 id="C5">Interaction</h2>

<!--
<h2>Computation</h2>
<h3>Randomness</h3>
