<p>Let's start with a definition.</p>
<p><b>The Universe</b> - the whole space and matter that situates in that space</p>
<br/>
<p><u><b>Assumption: the Universe is not a computer simulation.</b></u></p>
<p>This theory may be true, but if it is, then all is meaningless, cause our world is only a fiction, only zeros and ones. It doesn't matter) I don't see any sense in investigating what models and algorithms were used to create it. So this assumption is critical and needs to be underlined from the beginning. I hope you are on the same page with me on this question.</p>

<h2>Space</h2>

<h3>Is space infinite?</h3>

<h3>Does the existence imply finiteness?</h3>

<h3>What are lines and planes?</h3>
<p>Lines and planes are dividers of space. They are imaginary.</p>

<h3>Does space not filled with matter exist?</h3>

<h2>Matter</h2>

<h3>Is there infinite quantity of matter?</h3>

<h3>Is matter always symmetric? or Is there an asymmetric matter?</h3>

<h3>Are there different kinds of matter?</h3>

<h3>Are there different shapes of matter?</h3>

<h3>Can matter change its character/kind?</h3>
<p>Parmenides: How can a thing be said to change as you say e.g. that air changed into water and fire? To change means to become what it is not, but to say of what is that it is not is simply untrue. What is cannot not be anything, for "not to be" means vanish out of existence. "it is" i.e. one single thing exists.</p>



<h3>Did the Universe come into being?</h3>
<p><b>Ex nihilo nihil fit</b> - nothing comes from nothing.</p>
<p>The Universe couldn't emerge out of nothing and it has always been present.</p>
<p>We also state the reverse: nothing goes to nothing, i.e. nothing can't disappear.</p>
<h2>Movement</h2>

<h3>Can you travel in two directions simultaneously?</h3>

<h2>Interaction</h2>
