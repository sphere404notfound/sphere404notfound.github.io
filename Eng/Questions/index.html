<p>Let's start with a definition.</p>

<p><b>The Universe</b> - the whole space and matter that situates in that space</p>

<p><u><b>Assumption: the Universe is not a computer simulation.</b></u></p>
<p>This theory may be true, but if it is, then all is meaningless, cause our world is only a fiction, only zeros and ones. It doesn't matter) I don't see any sense in investigating what models and algorithms were used to create it. So this assumption is critical and needs to be underlined from the beginning. I hope you are on the same page with me on this question.</p>

<h2 id="C1">Space</h2>

<h3>Is space infinite?</h3>
<p>Isaac Newton: Since space is essentially void, it can have no boundaries.</p>

<h3>What are properties of space?</h3>
<p>Nikola Tesla: Space has no properties. But what about extension? Is it a property or not?</p>

<h3>Does the existence imply finiteness?</h3>

<h3>Does a point belong to space?</h3>
<p>No.</p>

<h3>What are lines and planes?</h3>
<p>Lines and planes are dividers of space. They are imaginary. This why any volume of space doesn't consist of points, segments of a line, squares of planes.</p>

<h3>Do asymmetric parts of space exist?</h3>

<h3>Incommensurability?</h3>

<!-- Even if we can not define the smallest part of space, we can say that any part consists of parts that are cubes. -->

<!-- Infinitely small - Karl Theodor Wilhelm Weierstraß and Augustin Louis Cauchy - Бесконечно малые величины - Коши и Вейерштрассе -->

<!-- Incommensurability of segments 5th century BC -->

<!-- Interesting thing:

1 = 2 = 3 - lengths of segments
infinity left - 1 - infinity right
infinity left - 1 - 2 - infinity right
infinity left - 1 - 2 - 3 - infinity right

- is infinity left > infinity right?
- is infinity left + 1 < 2 + 3 + infinity right?
- can we post a question that infinity left + 1 > infinity left + 1 + 2?

<h3>WHat are axioms of Euclid?</h3>

<h2 id="C2">Numbers</h2>

<h2 id="C3">Matter</h2>

<h3>What is a certain attribute of matter?</h3>
<p>Descartes, 1644: "You can't conceive a material object that doesn't occupy some space."</p>

<h3>Is there infinite quantity of matter?</h3>
<p>Let's assume that every pom (piece of matter) interacts with each other piece of matter or in other words every pom is connected to other poms. So if there is infinite quantity of poms, then how the trajectory of a pom can be defined? It becomes indefinite. Either not all poms are interconnected / interact and there can be (but not necessarily) infinite quantity of poms so it's definite where each pom will go next or they all are interconnected / interact and there can't be an infinite number of poms.</p>

<h3>Can there be infinitely small matter?</h3>
<p>If smth is infinitely small, then it's characteristic is indefinite, so how it can interact with anything? The result of interaction can't be definite.</p>

<h3>Can there be infinitely big matter?</h3>
<p>Same here as in case with infinitely small matter. </p>

<h3>Can there be infinite inner compoundness</h3>

<h3>Is matter always symmetric? or Is there an asymmetric matter?</h3>
<p>This question should be asked in the Space category with space instead of matter. And if asymmetric space exists, then why there can't exist asymmetric matter?</p>

<h3>Can fully unhomogeneous matter exist?</h3>

<h3>Are there different kinds of matter?</h3>

<!-- how we can tell different kinds of matter if not by interaction with other matter -->

<h3>Can there be infinite number of kinds of matter?</h3>

<h3>Are there different shapes of matter?</h3>

<h3>Can matter change its character/kind?</h3>
<p>Parmenides: How can a thing be said to change as you say e.g. that air changed into water and fire? To change means to become what it is not, but to say of what is that it is not is simply untrue. What is cannot not be anything, for "not to be" means vanish out of existence. "it is" i.e. one single thing exists.<br/>
If there were change, whatever changes would have to go from non-being or being to non-being.
</p>
<p>Who are critics of Parmenides?</p>

<h3>Can two kinds of matter coexist in one part of space? i.e. Can one part of space be filled with two different kings of matter simultaneously?</h3>
<p>So we can detect different kinds of matter according to the method of detection.</p>
<p><i>Maybe, should put it in Interaction.</i> </p>

<h3>Can matter occupy all the space? (i.e. is there any space not filled with matter)</h3>
<p>If all space is filled with matter and different kinds of matter can't coexist in one part of space, then matter can't move anywhere. In that case, the only possible variant for matter to move is for parts of matter to change their characteristics and provide us with an illusion of a moving object. But then the question arises, is it possible?</p>

<h3>Can matter change its characteristics without changing its volume?</h3>

<h3>Can matter take more/less space with changing its characteristics?</h3>

<h3>What Mendeleev's Table tells us?</h3>

<h3>Did the Universe come into being?</h3>
<p><b>Ex nihilo nihil fit</b> - nothing comes from nothing.</p>
<p>The Universe couldn't emerge out of nothing and it has always been present.</p>
<p>We also state the reverse: nothing goes to nothing, i.e. nothing can't disappear.</p>

<h3>Can matter even be divided into pieces?</h3>
<p>What holds "pieces" of some continouos piece of matter? What we divide? the matter itself or we just break the structure of not directly connected pieces?</p>
<p>If poms are interconnected via "threads" then what happens when pom is divided into two? Does new "threads" appear? Or are they rearranged?</p>


<!--Orders of structure and Fibonacci, golden ratio -->

<h3>Are there stars that consist of subatomic particles?</h3>

<h3>If you see thorugh "emptiness", there is something already.</h3>

<h3>How laser differs from sun light?</h3>

<!-- Balmer Series (also for Hydrogen)-->
<!-- Discretization - Claude Shannon-->

<h2 id="C4">Movement</h2>

<h3>Can you travel in two directions simultaneously?</h3>

<h3>Movement along a circle vs Circle as a figure (that can't exist)</h3>


<h3>What about teleportation?</h3>
<!-- philosophy of teleportation -->
<p>Aritstotle: The law of non-contradiction: Be and not be at the same time in the same respect - impossible.</p>
<p>How this law corresponds to teleportation?</p>

<h3>Is this kind of movement possible?</h3>
<p>Position 1</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>m1</td>
    <td>m2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>m3</td>
    <td>m4</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Position 2</p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>m2</td>
      <td>m4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>m1</td>
      <td>m3</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
<p>For this movement to be possible and gapless, pieces should teleport to their new positions instantenouosly without being present at all "half" positions.</p>

<h3>How in the world inertial movement exists? What is the essence of inertial movement?</h3>

<h3>What is energy?</h3>
<!-- Who came up with the concept of energy and how it was defined initially?-->
<p>t1 - v1; t2 - v1 : no energy wasted. So energy also refers only to interaction.</p>

<!-- How people crack Zeno's paradoxes? -->

<h3>What is velocity?</h3>

<h3>What is acceleratioin? Does it exist?</h3>
<p>If in every position the pom goes through it has velocity and acceleration, how is it possible?</p>

<!-- What is Lamor Frequency? -->

<h2>Computation</h2>
<h3>Randomness</h3>

<!-- Double slit experiment -->

<h3>Can unmoving move something?</h3>

<h3>Can indirect interaction even exist?</h3>

<h3>What about pull force?</h3>

<h3>What about creation of EM field in EM motor?</h3>

<h3>The kind of bond and the size of pom</h3>
<p>Let's assume pom is a cube. And let's assume that bonds are threads that have width and interconnect all poms. Also, that threads can't penetrate each other. </p>
<p>1. Can there be endless number of poms? - No. There isn't available surface on a pom.</p>
<p>2. The size of poms can't be smaller than width of threads.</p>
